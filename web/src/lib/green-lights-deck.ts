// Green Lights — the comfort & agreements questionnaire deck.
//
// Sibling to the Sex Quiz, but a different axis: not "does this turn me on"
// but "where do we stand on this." Answered double-blind; nothing reveals until
// both finish, then it shows where you AGREE (green lights + agreed limits) and
// the OPPOSITES — where you differ — as a "talk about these" list.
//
// ANSWER SCALES. Not every question is a yes/no. A statement forces the wrong
// frame on a preference ("quick or long?") or a want ("more often?"). So each
// card declares a `scale`, and the runner renders that scale's own buttons:
//
//   comfort — I'm good / Depends / No        (partner does X / a scenario)
//   agree   — Agree / It depends / Disagree   (a principle about how you operate)
//   want    — Yes, want this / Open to it / I'm good without  (more of something)
//   matters — A lot / Somewhat / Not really   (how much it matters to you)
//   prefer  — pole A / Either way / pole B     (this-vs-that, per-question poles)
//   cadence — frequency picker                 (reveal shows the gap, not a verdict)
//
// Option order is meaningful: index 0 is the most positive/yes pole, the last
// index the most negative/no pole (for `prefer`, the two ends are just opposite
// leanings, neither "good" nor "bad"). The reveal engine works on those
// positions, so it never hardcodes "good"/"no". Everything human-facing lives
// here; the server only stores opaque value ids keyed by card id.
//
// - heavy: true -> emotionally heavier (openness / cheating-adjacent); rendered
//   with a "worth talking through" tone and grouped toward the end.
// - valence: "concern" -> the top option admits a worry or a brake ("I feel
//   pressure to orgasm"). Both picking it is shared ground worth naming, not a
//   green light, so the reveal files it separately. Both picking the bottom
//   option (no worry) IS a green light.
//
// Ids are permanent. Stored answers are keyed by id: rewording keeps the id,
// a changed scale is safe (the reveal skips values that aren't current
// options, and the card counts as unanswered), and a dropped card's id moves
// to RETIRED_GREEN_LIGHT_IDS.

// Bumped whenever cards are added or re-scaled. Partners who answered an older
// deck get an "answer the new questions" prompt instead of a full retake.
