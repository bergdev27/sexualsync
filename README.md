Sexualsync is an app for two people who share one private room. It helps with the
conversations that are easier to write down than to start out loud: what you want
to try, where your limits are, what you have been thinking about.

There are no public profiles and nothing to sign up for. You host your own copy.

This is the self-host edition. It runs on a Node server with filesystem storage
and an in-process realtime room, so it works with no external services. You can
add Google sign-in, email codes, web push, and AI helpers later by setting a few
environment variables.

For consenting adults, 18+. Personal and noncommercial self-hosting is allowed;
commercial or hosted-service use is reserved. See the [license](#license).

## What's inside

Five tabs: **Home**, **Play**, **Ask**, **Sext** and **Us**.

- **Home** — what needs you, what you're waiting on, what you've planned, and
  what your partner has been up to. The **I'm horny** switch sits on top (or "open to being
  seduced" if you're not there yet): your partner only finds out if theirs
  is on too.
- **Ask** — the raised + in the middle of the tab bar. Send a concrete request
  with acts, timing and a filming preference. Your partner answers on one card
  (yes, maybe, pass, or a counter), and when you both say yes either of you can
  plan it for a time.
- **Sext** — a private message thread for two. Images are encrypted in the
  browser before they upload; messages written offline send when you're back.
- **Play** — Sex Quiz, Green Lights, The Pile and Blind Reveal let both people
  answer privately before anything is shown, plus Inspiration: kinks, links,
  clips and passages saved on the Shelf before they turn into a plan.
- **Us** — limits (hard nos, talk-first items, soft limits, with ask-blocking
  when a line would be crossed), your acts library, health stats, private
  notes, and the **Vault**: media encrypted in the browser with a passphrase
  the server never sees. Settings (notification presets, Room Encryption,
  account) open as a sheet.
- Data export, account deletion, PWA install, and generic notifications.

## Privacy and security

Sexualsync is built for a private room, not a social network.

- Sensitive records are encrypted at rest with versioned AES-GCM envelopes. On
  first boot the server generates and saves a strong `APP_SESSION_SECRET` if you
  have not set one.
- **Room Encryption** end-to-end encrypts new asks, limits, kinks, Shelf saves,
  Blind Reveals, custom acts, and Pile drops under a shared passphrase. The server
  never receives it, and a lost passphrase cannot be recovered.
- Vault media and Sext images are encrypted in the browser before upload.
- Sessions use HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies. Protected routes are gated by
  middleware, and responses that carry private state are sent `no-store`.
- Notifications and outbound email stay generic by default. No public search, no
  room listing, no ad profiles.

What it cannot protect against: an unlocked device someone else is holding, a
malicious browser extension, screen recording, or server-delivered JavaScript
that has been tampered with can all expose plaintext going forward. Read the
[threat model](docs/e2ee-threat-model.md) and the
[crypto review notes](docs/crypto-review-packet.md) before you rely on Room
Encryption for anything high-risk.

## Run it

### Docker

No clone needed. Grab the compose file and start the published image:

```bash
mkdir sexualsync && cd sexualsync
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bergdev27/sexualsync/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Update later with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Images are
published to `ghcr.io/bergdev27/sexualsync` for amd64 and arm64, tagged
`latest` and per release (`SEXUALSYNC_VERSION=2.0.1 docker compose up -d`
pins one). To build from source instead, clone the repo and run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build`.

Open http://localhost:8788.

Docker binds only `127.0.0.1:8788` by default. Put Caddy, nginx, or Traefik in
front of it for public TLS. Data lives in the `sexualsync-data` volume; back it
up, including the generated `session-secret`.

### Node

Node 20 or newer.

```bash
npm ci
npm --prefix web ci
npm run selfhost:build
cp .env.selfhost.example .env.selfhost
npm run selfhost:serve
```

Open http://localhost:8788.

For a private two-person room, set both emails in `.env.selfhost`:

```dotenv
PRIVATE_PREVIEW_ALLOWED_EMAILS=you@example.com,partner@example.com
LEGACY_MEMBERS_JSON=[{"email":"you@example.com","displayName":"You"},{"email":"partner@example.com","displayName":"Partner"}]
```

With no allowlist set, local email/password accounts are enabled so you can try a
fresh instance right away. Do not expose an instance publicly until you have set
the allowed emails, or deliberately set `PUBLIC_SIGNUPS_OPEN=1`.

## Optional services

The app runs without any of these.

- **Google OAuth** — `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH_BASE_URL`.
- **Email codes and invites** — `RESEND_API_KEY` plus the sender vars.
- **Web Push** — a matching VAPID public/private key pair.
- **AI helpers** — `LLM_ENABLED=1`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`. Intimate-content
  features also need `LLM_SENSITIVE_CONTENT_ALLOWED=1`.

Full config reference: [docs/self-host/CONFIG.md](docs/self-host/CONFIG.md).

## Verify it

```bash
npm test                # shared handler and product unit tests
npm run selfhost:test   # Node adapters, ws codec, room registry
npm run selfhost:smoke  # boots the server, exercises the real handlers over HTTP
npm run selfhost:smoke2 # two users: quiz + green-lights double-blind over HTTP
npm run selfhost:check  # config and Docker sanity
npm run selfhost:build  # production web build
```

Before you open an instance beyond one private couple, read
[docs/self-host/GOING-PUBLIC.md](docs/self-host/GOING-PUBLIC.md). Open signup is
not a single flag. You will need database-backed storage, real moderation and
reporting, and a legal posture that matches how you run it.

## Code map

```text
web/            Next.js app, built into dist/
functions/api/  Web-standard API handlers, the product logic
functions/      Middleware and routing glue
selfhost/       Node server, filesystem storage adapters, WebSocket room
workers/room/   StateStoreDurableObject, the CAS coordinator used by the tests
docs/           self-host, security, crypto, and threat-model notes
scripts/        build and config-check scripts
tests/          unit tests for the shared handlers
```

The API handlers are Web-standard, so they run unchanged on the Node server.
Reach storage through the seams (`getStore(env, name)`, `mutateKey`,
`mutateRecord`, `env.VAULT_MEDIA`, `env.ROOMS`) rather than calling a backend
directly.
