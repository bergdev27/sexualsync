// Server-side "needs you" count for the PWA home-screen badge (Badging API).
// The push path (_notification_policy.notifyWorkspaceEvent) attaches this as
// `badge` so the service worker can keep the icon count live while the app is
// closed. The foreground badge (Sexboard) trues the icon to the FULL needsYou
// set on the next app open; this push count mirrors that set so the icon
// matches what the app shows in "Needs you":
//   - Asks awaiting your reply (you're the reviewer, still pending/sent)
//   - Counters awaiting your call (you sent the Ask, your partner countered)
//   - Kinks needing your response (authored by your partner, no reply from you)
//   - Pile needing you (revealed, or you haven't dropped your acts yet)
//   - Blind Reveal needing you (open, and you haven't answered yet)
// Unread chat is the only needsYou contributor intentionally NOT counted here
// yet — it converges on the next open. The Pile / Blind Reveal conditions
// mirror buildHandoffs() in web/src/app/sexboard/_sexboard-body.tsx and reuse
// the SAME readers the live Sexboard does (sexboard.js), so they can't drift.
//
// Dynamic import() of the readers avoids a static init-time cycle: request-
// board.js, fantasy-backlog.js, pile.js and blind-reveals.js all statically
// import _notification_policy.js, which imports this module.
